Try intel gpu tools
Change names like toggle_transform_type into toggleTransformType
Make a view below field and above ground, with XYZ movement
Accessors for scene
Better container than fieldlist
Make geometry member of glgrib_world protected
Add [] operator to glgrib_field_float_buffer_ptr
Optimisations : 
- use mapped buffers
- use lat/lon
- use compressed lat/lon
- reduce CPU usage
Use preprocessor for shaders

Handle orography in geometry
Optimize coordinates latlon->XYZ in shaders
Use lat/lon in lines, contour, stream
